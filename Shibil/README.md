ASSIGNMENT 1
Data Preprocessing and Decision Tree Classification

Objective:
To implement a complete data mining pipeline including preprocessing, feature selection, classification and evaluation.

Files Included:
- student_data.csv (Dataset)
- decision_tree.py (Python implementation)

Steps Implemented:

1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded CSV file
- Displayed number of records
- Displayed attributes count
- Printed class distribution

2. Data Preprocessing
- Missing values handled
- Target column encoded
- Numerical attributes normalized

3. Feature Selection
- Gini Index used
- Feature importance displayed

4. Decision Tree Classification
- Dataset split into training and testing
- Decision Tree model trained

5. Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score calculated

Language Used:
Python
